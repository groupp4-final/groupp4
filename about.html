    <h1>About This Project</h1>

    <p class="intro">
        This project, <strong>Web Mapping of Texas’ 14 Nationally Protected Areas</strong>,
        was created for the Web Mapping course (GEO 4422) with Dr. Yihong Yuan.
        Its purpose is to provide an accessible interactive map that helps users explore
        the geographic distribution, characteristics, and recreational opportunities
        of federally protected areas in Texas.
    </p>

    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
    <p>
        Using open-source data from Texas Parks and Wildlife, Texas Land Trust Council,
        OpenStreetMap, and USGS, we created polygon boundaries, popups, buffers,
        and interactive map tools using Leaflet and Turf.js. The application demonstrates
        how free online mapping tools can be used to visualize preserved lands and
        support public engagement with conservation areas.
