# This project was designed to make an interactive map of all the protected lands of Texas. By creating a buffer, a search tool, and a selection for your basemap; this interactive mapping creates a fun and informative site for viewers. As a group, we strived to make a simple hub for information on each park. When selecting each protected land, you will be greeted with a link to the appropriate website for booking and viewing of what the land has to offer. On the Navigation bar you can read the reasoning for the project as well as meet the creators of it.
